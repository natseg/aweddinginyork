We have decided to come up with a plan to rent a cottage somewhere in the countryside with:
- spirits
- boardgames
- music
- food
- outdoor activities (hiking)

If you can't make it, we will miss you but we won't be upset!

If you can make it, please note gaming and/or hiking is not optional.

To get an idea of when is best for you.

We will try and choose a place easy to get to.
