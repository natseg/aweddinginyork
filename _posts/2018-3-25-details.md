The 14th century Hospitium is a two-storey listed building set within the beautiful York Museum Gardens in York city centre, overlooked by the striking ruins of the Grade 1 listed St. Maryâ€™s Abbey.

It's only a short walk from the train station, and even closer to the bus stop outside the gardens.
